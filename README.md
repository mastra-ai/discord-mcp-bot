# Discord MCP Bot - Mastra Component

The Mastra component of the Discord MCP Bot system that provides intelligent assistance and answers questions about Mastra.ai. This component handles the Mastra-specific functionality and integrates with [discord-mcp-server](https://github.com/mastra-ai/discord-mcp-server) for Discord interactions.

## Overview

This component leverages Mastra's MCP tools and GPT-4 to:
- Process questions about Mastra.ai, its features, and capabilities
- Generate responses with relevant documentation links and examples
- Provide expert guidance on Mastra.ai implementation
- Share contextually appropriate code examples

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.0+
- npm
- OpenAI API key
- Access to discord-mcp-server

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra
   cd examples/discord-mcp-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. Run locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Mastra component in the Mastra playground.
